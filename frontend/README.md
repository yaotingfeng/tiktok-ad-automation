# FastAPI Project - Frontend

The frontend is built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), [React](https://react.dev/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query), [TanStack Router](https://tanstack.com/router), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/).

## Requirements

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/)

## Quick Start

From the project root, install the dependencies and start the frontend development server:

```bash
bun install
bun run dev
```

Then open <http://localhost:5173/> in your browser.

Run `uv run bash scripts/prestart.sh` and `uv run fastapi dev` from the `backend` directory, with PostgreSQL running in Docker Compose. See [../development.md](../development.md) for the complete setup.

To serve the frontend with FastAPI, run `bun run build` from the `frontend` directory and open `http://localhost:8000`.

Check `frontend/package.json` to see the other available commands.

## 引导式体验版（/demo/）

体验版是同一套页面的独立构建：入口 `demo/index.html` → `src/demo/main.tsx`，所有接口由浏览器内假后端（`src/demo/handlers`）就地应答，不连接任何后端或 TikTok，链接可公开分享。`bun run build` 会同时产出 `backend/app/frontend/demo/`，由后端以 `/demo/` 提供；平台租户管理页有“打开体验版”入口。

- 本地开发：`bun run dev:demo`，打开 <http://localhost:5180/demo/>。
- 接口变化后：`bun run generate-client` 之后运行 `bun run demo:operations`，并为新接口在 `src/demo/handlers` 注册演示处理（确实无需演示的写入 `src/demo/coverage-exemptions.ts` 并注明原因）；`bun run demo:coverage` 检查覆盖。
- 端到端检查：`bun x playwright test --config=playwright.demo.config.ts`（隔离、逐页巡检、主线引导全程）。
- 改动页面文案时注意 `src/demo/tour/tours.ts` 按可见文字定位，端到端检查会发现失效的引导步骤。
- 体验版结果只是演示，不能作为任何真实联调或验收证据。

## Removing the Frontend

If you are developing an API-only app and want to remove the frontend, you can do it easily:

* Remove the `./frontend` directory.

* In the `backend/app/main.py` file, remove the `app.frontend()` call.

* In the `backend/Dockerfile` file, remove the frontend build stage and the `COPY --from=frontend-build` instruction.

* In the `compose.override.yml` file, remove the `playwright` service.

* In the `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file, remove the **Set up Bun**, **Install frontend dependencies**, and **Build frontend** steps.

* In the `.fastapicloudignore` file, remove the `!backend/app/frontend/` entry.

Done, you now have an API-only app. 🤓

## Generate Client

### Automatically

* From the project root, run the script:

```bash
bash ./scripts/generate-client.sh
```

* Commit the changes.

### Manually

* Make sure the backend is running.

* Download the OpenAPI JSON file from `http://localhost:8000/api/v1/openapi.json` and copy it to a new file `openapi.json` at the root of the `frontend` directory.

* To generate the frontend client, run:

```bash
bun run generate-client
```

* Commit the changes.

Regenerate the client whenever backend changes affect the OpenAPI schema.

## Using a Remote API

By default, the built frontend uses the same origin as the FastAPI app. If you want to use a remote API while running the Vite development server, you can set the environment variable `VITE_API_URL` to the URL of the remote API. For example, you can set it in the `frontend/.env` file:

```env
VITE_API_URL=https://my-domain.example.com
```

Then, when you run the frontend, it will use that URL as the base URL for the API.

## Code Structure

The frontend code is structured as follows:

* `frontend/src` - The main frontend code.
* `frontend/public` - Static assets.
* `frontend/src/client` - The generated OpenAPI client.
* `frontend/src/components` - The components of the frontend, including the shadcn/ui components in `frontend/src/components/ui`.
* `frontend/src/hooks` - Custom hooks.
* `frontend/src/lib` - Shared frontend utilities.
* `frontend/src/routes` - The frontend routes and pages.

## End-to-End Testing with Playwright

The frontend includes initial end-to-end tests using Playwright. To run the tests, you need to have the Docker Compose stack running. Start the stack with the following command:

```bash
docker compose run --rm backend bash scripts/prestart.sh
docker compose up -d --wait backend
```

Then, you can run the tests with the following command:

```bash
bunx playwright test
```

You can also run your tests in UI mode to see the browser and interact with it running:

```bash
bunx playwright test --ui
```

To stop and remove the Docker Compose stack and clean the data created in tests, use the following command:

```bash
docker compose down -v
```

To update the tests, navigate to the tests directory and modify the existing test files or add new ones as needed.

For more information on writing and running Playwright tests, refer to the official [Playwright documentation](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro).
